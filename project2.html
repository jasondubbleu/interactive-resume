					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This project is a comprehensive setup guide for students learning Git and Bitbucket for the first time. 
					It walks users through installing GitBash, creating local and online repositories, generating SSH keys, 
					and securely linking those repositories. The guide is tailored for Windows users at Florida State University,
					especially those unfamiliar with version control systems, and is designed to reduce confusion and prevent common errors. 
					It focuses on clear language, visual references, and step-by-step instructions to help students establish a working 
					repository structure for use in future coursework.</p>

				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>I independently researched, wrote, and designed the entire guide, from content structure to final 
				formatting. Every step, definition, and screenshot was created and selected by me to ensure clarity 
				and accuracy for first-time users. During peer review, no changes were recommended, which reinforced 
				the guideâ€™s effectiveness. This project reflects my ability to break down technical processes into 
				accessible, user-friendly documentation.</p>
